    <u><h2>About Fyodor Dostoevsky:</h2></u>
    <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist, and journalist, widely regarded as one of the greatest literary figures in both Russian and world literature. Born in Moscow in 1821, he was introduced to literature at an early age and later pursued writing as his life's work. His novels explore the depths of human psychology, morality, and existential struggles, often set against the backdrop of 19th-century Russia's political and social turmoil.

Dostoevsky's most acclaimed works include *Crime and Punishment*, *The Idiot*, *Demons*, and *The Brothers Karamazov*. His novella *Notes from Underground* is considered one of the first existentialist literary works. His life was marked by hardship, including imprisonment in Siberia for his involvement in a literary group critical of Tsarist Russia. He also struggled with financial difficulties and a gambling addiction, which influenced his writing.

Despite these challenges, Dostoevsky's works remain deeply influential, shaping modern literature, philosophy, and psychology. His ability to capture the complexities of human nature and moral dilemmas continues to resonate with readers worldwide.</p>
